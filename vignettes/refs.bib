abstract="Sample size determination for case-control studies of chronic disease are often based on the simple 2 X 2 tabular cross-classification of exposure and disease, thereby ignoring stratification which may be considered in the analysis. One consequence of this approach is that the sample size may be inadequate to attain a specified power and size when performing a statistical analysis on J 2 X 2 tables using Cochran's (1954, Biometrics 10, 417-451) statistic or the Mantel-Haenszel (1959, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 22, 719-748) statistic. A sample size formula is derived from Cochran's statistic and it is compared with the corresponding one derived when the data are treated as unstratified, and also with two other formulas proposed for stratified data analysis. The formula developed yields values slightly higher than one recently proposed by Mu{\~n}oz and Rosner (1984, Biometrics 40, 995-1004), which assumes that both margins of each 2 X 2 table are fixed, while the present study considers only the case-control margin to be fixed.",

abstract="Woolson, Bean, and Rojas (1986, Biometrics 42, 927-932) present a simple approximation of sample size for Cochran's (1954, Biometrics 10, 417-451) test for detecting association between exposure and disease. It is useful in the design of case-control studies. We derive a sample size formula for Cochran's statistic with continuity correction which guarantees that the actual Type I error rate of the test does not exceed the nominal level. The corrected sample size is necessarily larger than the uncorrected one given by Woolson et al. and the relative difference between the two sample sizes is considerable. Allocation of equal number of cases and controls within each stratum is asymptotically optimal when the costs per case and control are the same. When any effect of stratification is absent, Cochran's stratified test, although valid, is less efficient than the unstratified one except for the important case of a balanced design.",

abstract = "A simple approximation is presented for the asymptotic power of the Mantel-Haenszel procedure for testing the hypothesis that the common odds ratio in a collection of 2 x 2 tables is unity. This approximation is particularly useful in evaluating the power of a study with several strata which reaches negative conclusions. The corresponding formula is also provided for estimating the sample size before such a study has begun, by approximating the margins of the stratum-specific tables with estimates obtained from pre-existing data.-from Authors",

 abstract = {The Mantel-Haenszel (MH) test (Mantel and Haenszel 1959) is a widely used method for analyzing sets of two-by-two tables that compare the outcome of two treatments in several strata (Bailar and Anthony 1977). The procedure tests the null hypothesis of no partial association between treatment and outcome in any of the strata, or tables, against the alternative that the partial association, as measured by the common odds ratio, differs from 1. Birch (1964) showed that for a fixed number of tables, both the MH test and an earlier version due to Cochran (1954) are asymptotically identical to the uniformly most powerful unbiased test of this hypothesis. This article is concerned with calculating the power of the MH test as a prelude to embarking upon a study. We consider versions of the test with and without corrections for continuity. The spirit behind the approximations is that, although the odds ratio is the appropriate parameter for computing asymptotic power under local alternatives, in practice studies are designed for nonlocal alternatives. Our approach is based on evaluating a weighted difference of proportions of success in each table, rather than a weighted average of log-odds ratios, and is valid even if the odds ratios differ from table to table. The adequacy of our approximations to power is evaluated for planning three types of studies: the comparative binomial (CB), the double dichotomy (DD), and the survey (SY). In the CB trial, the proportion λ<sub>i</sub> of patients in the ith strata, as well as the proportion ρ<sub>i</sub> of patients in the ith strata who are assigned to the first treatment, are constants (i = 1, 2,..., N). For the DD only the ρ<sub>i</sub>'s are constant, whereas for the SY both vectors are random variables. We first approximate power under the condition that for each stratum NE(λ<sub>i</sub>) is large. This approximation cannot distinguish between corrected and uncorrected statistics nor among the different sampling schemes. In some sampling schemes, the number of patients per table is fixed but the number of tables increases. The more accurate approximation presented in this article is based on the expected value and variance of the numerator and denominator of the MH statistic for each design and yields different estimates of power for each design. Simulation studies show that for the CB the new approximations for power are closer to the exact values than previously obtained formulas. We also present designs in which the CB power differs markedly from that of the DD, and we show that our approximations do an excellent job of tracking these differences. This comparison also indicates that the strategy of poststratification may in some situations lead to an appreciable loss of power.},

Overall, the 122,328 respondents (69.7 per cent) and 43,222 non-respondents were quite similar. Together with the reasonable response rate in a homogeneous population, this suggests that estimation of exposure-disease associations is unlikely to be affected by major bias due to non-response.",

abstract="Among 989 cases of breast cancer and 9,890 controls selected from a cohort of married, female registered nurses aged 30-55 years, the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer for women who had ever used oral contraceptives (OC) compared with those who had never used them was 1.0, with 95\% confidence limits 0.9-1.2. Among OC users, there was no consistent pattern of excess risk with increasing duration; in fact, the few women who had used OC longest (greater than 10 yr) had a slightly lower risk than never-users. Moreover, there was no association between OC use and breast cancer among women with a positive history of breast cancer in the mother or sister or with OC use before their first pregnancy. The only subgroup of women among whom any adverse effect was apparent was current OC users aged 50-55 years (two onsets expected vs. seven observed). This finding is consistent with earlier reports of an increased risk of breast cancer among older OC users; however, it is also likely to reflect, at least to some extent, the play of chance, since at ages 45-49 and in each younger age group fewer cases than expected were observed among current OC users.",
